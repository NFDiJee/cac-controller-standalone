## Overview

The CAC Controller turns a Pioneer CD autochanger into a network-controllable music server. It communicates via RS-232C serial protocol, provides a real-time web interface over WebSocket, and maintains a full CD library database with metadata from MusicBrainz.

## Database Schema

The SQLite database contains the following tables:

- **cds** - CD metadata (slot, title, artist, year, genre, cover, MusicBrainz ID, barcode, label, country)
- **tracks** - Track metadata (title, artist, duration, ISRC)
- **playlists** / **playlist_items** - User-created playlists
- **play_history** - Automatic play tracking
- **favorites** - Favorited tracks and CDs
- **ratings** - 1-5 star ratings
- **settings** - Application configuration (key-value store)

## Pioneer Serial Protocol

This project implements the complete Pioneer CAC serial protocol as documented in the official Programming Manual (Version 2.0, May 1993).

### Communication Parameters
- **Baud Rate**: 9600 (V3000/V3200/V5000) or 4800 (V180M)
- **Data Bits**: 8
- **Stop Bits**: 1
- **Parity**: None
- **Terminator**: CR (`\r`)
- **Max Command Length**: 20 characters

### Command Format
All commands are prefixed with the player ID and `PS` (Player Select):
```
<player_id>PS<command>\r
```
Example: `1PS001ZSPL\r` selects player 1, loads disc 001, and starts playback.

### Supported Commands
- **27 Execution Commands**: Player select, disc select/return, start, reject, play, pause, scan, search, stop marker, auto-cue, volume, speed, fade, and more
- **14 Query Commands**: Player mode, disc number, track number, time code, TOC info, model name, disc status, and more

## Updating

```bash
cd /opt/cac-controller
